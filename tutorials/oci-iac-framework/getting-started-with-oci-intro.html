<p>Over the last two decades, Cloud Computing has revolutionized the technological landscape, allowing companies to rent infrastructure instead of building rapidly-obsolescing hardware on-site. During this time, the architectural approach integrating infrastructure orchestration and application code into cloud services has evolved with it.</p>

<p>Today, cloud users have a choice between technology stacks for virtual hosts, master-slave architectures, and container clusters. Each stack wraps application code differently, relies on different methods to launch servers, and provides different mechanisms to automate fail-over and scaling processes. For Enterprise IT organizations managing a large variety of applications, a single stack is usually insufficient to address the broad variety of functional and non-functional requirements.</p>

<p>Hence, spreading workloads across multiple cloud providers is a common strategy to address this constraint. However, deploying private workloads across multiple public infrastructure stacks increases operational complexity significantly and comes with certain vulnerabilities.</p>

<p>This makes adopting a second generation infrastructure service (IaaS) like <a href="https://www.oracle.com/cloud/">Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI)</a> an attractive alternative. Purpose-built hardware enables cloud providers to separate the orchestration layer from the hosts and allows cloud customers to build private data centers on pre-built infrastructure pools. Programming interfaces allow operators to build extensible service delivery platforms and service owners to modernize applications in incremental steps. The bare-metal approach allows customers to run enterprise applications in a traditional way. Cloud orchestrators remain optional, and can be added as managed service, but even then the user remains in control over the infrastructure resources.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.oracle.com/cloud/architecture-and-regions.html"><img src="https://www.oracle.com/a/ocom/img/rc24-oci-region-map.png" alt="Data Center Regions" /></a></p>

<p>Oracle operates a fast-growing network of data centers to provide access to pre-built cloud infrastructure in more than 30 regions. In addition, Oracle builds private infrastructure pools on-demand, and offers to extend these pools with edge compute or database nodes. In every data center, dedicated compute and storage resources are isolated on a native layer three network. Orchestrators, including hypervisor, container, and network functions, remain private by default and also exist in shared pools. Combining open-source orchestration technologies with cloud-agnostic monitoring and management services allows operators to build a control center for hybrid cloud services.</p>

<p>End-to-end programmability ensures fast and flexible resource deployments. Platform components like middleware, integration, and database infrastructure, provided either as managed or as unmanaged services, offer a choice between convenience and control. At the same time, standard hardware controls like the <a href="https://www.oracle.com/servers/technologies/integrated-lights-out-manager.html">integrated lights out manager (ILOM)</a> and <a href="https://blogs.oracle.com/cloud-infrastructure/first-principles-l2-network-virtualization-for-lift-and-shift">off-box virtualization</a> allow customers to address regional privacy regulations and compliance requirements.</p>

<p>Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) is a deep and broad platform of public cloud services that enables customers to build and run a wide range of applications in a scalable, secure, highly available, and high-performance environment.</p>

<p>For on-premises requirements, OCI is available with the new Dedicated Region Cloud@Customer located both behind a company’s private firewall and in their data center.</p>

<h2 id="whats-next">What’s next</h2>

<p>Cloud operations engineering is a relatively new field which extends the scope of IT service management (ITSM). It represents an important step towards more agility and flexibility in service operation. The concept of “Infrastructure as Code” replaces runbook tools and has become an enabler of self-service delivery, even for complex solution architectures. Operators empower service owners and developers to add, change, or delete infrastructure on demand with deployment templates for logical resources. Service consumers gain flexibility to provision virtual infrastructure, while resource operators remain in control of the physical infrastructure.</p>

<p>This series aims to provide a path for IT organizations introducing cloud engineering. We start with a short introduction of Infrastructure as Code (IaC), show how to define logical resources for application and database services, and end with an example showing how to consolidate infrastructure and application services in a self-service catalogue. We’ll build on the official <a href="https://www.oracle.com/cloud/iaas/training/">Oracle Cloud Architect training</a> which prepares administrators for the <a href="https://www.oracle.com/cloud/iaas/training/architect-associate.html">Oracle Architect Associate exam</a>, but extend the <a href="https://learn.oracle.com/ols/learning-path/become-oci-architect-associate/35644/75658">Learning Path</a> with tool recommendations and code examples for cloud engineers.</p>
