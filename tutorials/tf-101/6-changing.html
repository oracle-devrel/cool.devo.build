    <p>Most DevOps environments tend to change on a regular basis. These changes can be easily managed in a reliable, scalable way using Terraform. Let’s try this out now.</p>

  <div class="slide" id="slide-1">

    <h2 class="slide__title"><span class="slide__num">2</span> Prerequisites</h2>

    <p>I’m assuming that you’re building off of the environment found in the <a href="5-creating">Creating Resources with Terraform tutorial</a>.</p>

    <h2 class="slide__title"><span class="slide__num">3</span> Managing Change</h2>

    <p>When managing an environment with Terraform, there are largely three data sources that Terraform relies on:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Terraform Code</li>
      <li>Terraform State</li>
      <li>Environment As-Built</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 id="terraform-code">Terraform Code</h3>
    <p>The Terraform code is where you tell Terraform what you want it to manage. As you’ve already seen, Terraform code is just a plain-text file with a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.tf</code> extension.</p>

    <p>Many teams find it beneficial to commit their Terraform source code to a version control system (VCS) such as a git repository. The VCS allows for limiting access to the source code (which can effectively contain your Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) topology, assuming it’s defined in Terraform code). Another benefit to using a VCS is having a natural audit trail of what has transpired in the environment (who did what and when).</p>

    <h3 id="terraform-state">Terraform State</h3>
    <p>The Terraform state is a critical piece of information that Terraform will use upon each execution, cross-referencing what is deployed against the code and against what is cached in the state. Additional resource data points are stored in the state, such as the OCID for a resource (after it’s been created) as well as other attributes which might not be explicitly set in the Terraform code.</p>

    <p>When working as a team, it’s important that each team member have a current, up-to-date copy of the Terraform state. To keep things consistent, only one member of the team should make changes to the environment at any single point in time.</p>

    <p>By default, the Terraform state is stored in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">terraform.tfstate</code> file located in the working directory. There are several options for managing the Terraform State, but for now we’ll be using the <a href="https://www.terraform.io/docs/language/settings/backends/local.html">local backend</a>, which happens to be the default.</p>

    <h3 id="environment-as-built">Environment As-Built</h3>
    <p>During each run, Terraform will check the current as-built state of the environment, comparing it against the Terraform State and the provided code, to determine what might need to occur to bring the actual environment configuration into alignment with the desired end-state configuration given in the Terraform code.</p>

    <p>The above code adds three new subnets: one development subnet, one testing subnet and, one staging subnet. Each of these is placed in the specified compartment within the VCN that was created in the <a href="5-creating">previous tutorial</a>. Each subnet has a unique IPv4 CIDR block which falls within the broader VCN IPv4 CIDR block. None of the subnets permit public IPs to be used (they’re prohibited).</p>

    <p>Voila! Your VCN now has three subnets in it. This was a really easy way to add OCI resources to the VCN: just add to the Terraform code in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">main.tf</code> and ask Terraform to apply it!</p>

    <p>As your fictitious environment is coming together, you realize that the name of the development subnet isn’t ideal. Rather than calling it <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">dev_1</code>, let’s say you want to rename it to just <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">dev</code>.</p>

    <p>Because Terraform uses Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC), this can be done with a few minor changes to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">main.tf</code> file, after which you just tell Terraform to apply it. It’s that easy!</p>

    <p>Modify the existing the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">oci_core_subnet.dev_1</code> resource definition in your <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">main.tf</code> to match the following:</p>

    <p>Oh no - it looks like something has gone terribly awry! Terraform wants to destroy the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">dev_1</code> subnet and create a new <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">dev</code> subnet.</p>

    <p>Let’s find out why.</p>

    <h3 id="why-is-a-resource-being-deleted-and-re-created">Why is a Resource Being Deleted-and-Re-Created?</h3>

    <p>There are two primary reasons why a resource might be destroyed and re-created:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>platform (cloud) constraints</li>
      <li>renaming a resource name</li>
    </ul>

    <p>In OCI, many changes are non-disruptive. However, there are some resource changes that might be disruptive. Take for instance the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">dns_label</code> attribute. According to the <a href="https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/oci/latest/docs/resources/core_subnet#dns_label">OCI provider documentation for the Subnet resource</a>, the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">dns_label</code> cannot be changed. This would mean that if you wanted to change it on an existing OCI Subnet, you could see this delete-and-re-create behavior. Terraform is smart enough to know that if an attribute cannot be updated in-place, then it must delete and re-create the resource.</p>

    <p>The second situation occurs when you totally change the name of a resource in the Terraform code and don’t ask Terraform to update the Terraform state. From Terraform’s perspective, it looks like you want to delete the old resource (which is present in the Terraform state, but does not exist in the code) and create a net-new resource (because your code refers to a resource that’s non-existent in the Terraform state).</p>

    <p>This can be a common mistake and be troublesome, but it can be easily resolved. Rename the resource name in the Terraform state from the old name to the new name. Terraform will then move forward as expected. Do this now with the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">terraform state mv</code> command:</p>

    <div class="language-console highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="gp">$</span><span class="w"> </span>terraform state <span class="nb">mv </span>oci_core_subnet.dev_1 oci_core_subnet.dev
<span class="go">Move "oci_core_subnet.dev_1" to "oci_core_subnet.dev"
Successfully moved 1 object(s).
</span></code></pre></div>    </div>

    <p>The above command asks Terraform to rename (move) the old resource name to a new resource name in the Terraform State. Take a look at the <a href="https://www.terraform.io/docs/cli/commands/state/mv.html">Terraform documentation</a> for more information.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> When referencing resources in Terraform, both the type of resource and its name must be used. This is why in the above command, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">oci_core_subnet.dev_1</code> is used instead of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">dev_1</code>.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote class="notice">
      <p>The same resource name may be used multiple times as long as it’s used for different types of resources. For example, an OCI Route Table called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">dev_1</code> could also exist without problem (referenced as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">oci_core_route_table.dev_1</code>).
When choosing names for your resources, it’s unnecessary (and a bad idea) to include the type of resource in its name, because the resource type will always prefix the name when referencing it.
For example, instead of using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">oci_core_subnet.subnet_dev_1</code>, consider using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">oci_core_subnet.dev_1</code>. It’s clear that this is referencing a subnet. However, the second version is a lot shorter and easier to read!</p>

    <p>This tutorial took a slight detour, highlighting a scenario where a resource had to be renamed in the Terraform State to achieve the desired outcome, but now your OCI environment has a VCN with three subnets in it.</p>

    <p>We’ve had fun creating new OCI resources and then making modifications to the environment. It’s now time to clean things up. We’ll explore destroying resources in the <a href="7-destroying">next lesson</a>.</p>
