# The values here represent the defaults if nothing is set

  debug: false

  # The default document collection to paginate if nothing is specified ('posts' is default)
  collection: 'posts'

  # How many objects per paginated page, used to be `paginate` (default: 0, means all)
  per_page: 10

  # The permalink structure for the paginated pages (this can be any level deep)
  permalink: '/page/:num/' # Pages are index.html inside this folder (default)
  #permalink: '/page/:num.html' # Pages are simple html files
  #permalink: '/page/:num' # Pages are html files, linked jekyll extensionless permalink style.

  # Optional the title format for the paginated pages (supports :title for original page title, :num for pagination page number, :max for total number of pages)
  title: ':title - page :num'

  # Limit how many pagenated pages to create (default: 0, means all)
  limit: 0

  # Optional, sorts the posts in reverse order (omit to default decending or sort_reverse: true)
  sort_reverse: true

  # Optional, the default category to use, omit or just leave this as 'posts' to get a backwards-compatible behavior (all posts)
  category: 'posts'

  # Optional, the default tag to use, omit to disable
  tag: ''

  # Optional, the default locale to use, omit to disable (depends on a field 'locale' to be specified in the posts,
  # in reality this can be any value, suggested are the Microsoft locale-codes (e.g. en_US, en_GB) or simply the ISO-639 language code )
  locale: ''

 # Optional,omit or set both before and after to zero to disable.
 # Controls how the pagination trail for the paginated pages look like.
  trail:
    before: 2
    after: 2

  # Optional, the default file extension for generated pages (e.g html, json, xml).
  # Internally this is set to html by default
  extension: html

  # Optional, the default name of the index file for generated pages (e.g. 'index.html')
  # Without file extension
  indexpage: 'index'
