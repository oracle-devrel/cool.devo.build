<p>This is the official Oracle DevRel Community (OCI DevRel) Public Slack.</p>

<p>We strive for an open and welcoming community which respects all people
who contribute to our open-source projects and via this Slack channel.
We are committed to making the OCI DevRel Community a pleasant,
knowledgeable, and enjoyable experience for everyone. As such, we are
providing this Code of Conduct (CoC) to ensure all are welcome.</p>

<p>The OCI DevRel Public Slack is a dedicated community for anyone to
gather for support and collaboration around the Oracle Cloud Platform
ecosystem. Started in 2021, this Slack community has grown to hundreds
of active individuals from around the world who have gathered to share
their knowledge and expertise.</p>

<p>By using this Slack Channel, you agree to abide by the following Code of
Conduct, the <a href="https://slack.com/acceptable-use-policy">Slack Acceptable Use

policy</a> (pinned to the #general
channel). We reserve the right to update this code of conduct at any
time. When updates do occur, a message will be posted in the proper
channels to notify users.</p>

<h3 id="expectations">Expectations</h3>

<p>The OCI DevRel Public Slack is not an official support channel of
Oracle. While this Slack may contain Oracle employees who are happy to
assist where they can, please refrain from mentioning or messaging
Oracle employees with direct questions. If you have a question in which
you require direct support from Oracle, please use our <a href="https://support.oracle.com/MMOS/faces/welcome.jspx">official support
channel or the community
forums</a>. Oracle
reserves the right to enforce, interpret, and extend these guidelines
for the betterment of the community.</p>
